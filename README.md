# ofxThreadedGlobalMouseListener

Currently Windows-only addon that creates a window-independent mouse listener thread. Useful for applications without a window or that use click-through windows that ignore mouse events.

OS X implementation coming soon.

Tested only on Windows 10 with OF 0.10.1, but in theory this addon should work with most earlier versions of Windows.
